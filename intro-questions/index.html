        <p>1. My name is Liz Van Horn, and I am a junior majoring in history and communication design.</p> 
        <p>2. As a communication design major, I've always been especially interested in web design. I'm taking this class because it is a requirement, but I feel like I'd take it regardless in order to see how my design can exist in the web world.</p>
        <p>3. The only experience I have with HTML/CSS is from Digital Studio, but I don't remember most of it.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to make 2D design interactive.</p>
        <p>5. I expect designing for screen to involve different color and legibility choices.</p>
        <p>6. <a href="https://www.kellylaurendesign.com/">Kel Lauren's site</a> is pretty effective to me because it's very minimal but interactive and easy to understand.</p>
        <p>7. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times' site</a>provides effective communication in that it looks like a newspaper and has similar structure/hierarchies.</p>
        <p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a>works well as a site because the UI is set up in a way where everything is pretty clear and easy to find. The fonts are also great for web and everything is easy to read.</p>
